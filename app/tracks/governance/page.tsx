        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          Rather than reactive regulation, anticipatory governance proactively shapes AI development through multi-stakeholder dialogue, scenario planning, and adaptive frameworks. This track brings together policymakers, technologists, and civil society to co-create governance models that balance innovation with safety.

            <strong>Governing Autonomous Agents:</strong> When AI agents make decisions independently, who is responsible? How do we audit their behavior? What rights should they have (if any)? Join a facilitated debate with legal scholars, AI researchers, and ethicists.
