Successfully reverted previous incorrect changes and updated the AI Vision Forum Paris 2026 website with the **CORRECT** planning document (v3.0).

## Source Documents

## Changes Made

### 1. Git History Cleanup
- Reset repository to commit `bed796e` (before incorrect update)
- Force-pushed to remove commits that used wrong planning document

### 2. Event Context Updates

#### Guiding Question (NEW)
> "As AI reshapes human roles, how do we ensure human core values remain central?"

For Paris, sharpened by the reality that AI coding agents are now reshaping software development, open-source governance, and the $3T SaaS industry itself.

#### Why Now: Three Structural Shifts (NEW)
1. **The Rise of Spec-Driven Development (the "Dark Factory")**
   - L0-L5 framework (Dan Shapiro)
   - StrongDM's 3-person Software Factory proof point
   - AWS Kiro, GitHub spec-kit, Tessl commercialization

2. **The Governance Gap for AI Agents**
   - OWASP Agentic AI Top 10
   - AAIF (Linux Foundation, MCP, AGENTS.md)
   - StrongDM Leash (Cedar-based agent policies)
   - EU AI Act enforcement Aug 2, 2026

3. **Open-Source Sustainability Crisis Amplified by AI**
   - Tailwind CSS 80% revenue decline
   - 60% maintainers unpaid
   - 454K malicious packages (2025)
   - New funding models emerging

#### Unique Value Proposition (NEW)
- Two-layer governance (human ethics + agent security)
- Timing sweet spot (post-MCP Dev Summit, pre-EU AI Act)
- Cross-cultural bridge (US/EU/China)
- Durable framing over hype

| C | Ethics & Governance | Two Levels: Human Ethics AND Agent Security | EU AI Act, OWASP Top 10, Cedar |
